  <h3>What is Cast?</h3>
  Cast is a platform for deploying and managing applications. Think of Cast as
  your very own Platform as a Service that you can use in the cloud or even in
  your datacenter. Cast is flexible enough to integrate with existing
  deployment workflows, but powerful enough to be used as a standalone
  deployment platform.

<h3>Who is Cast For?</h3>
<div class="left_column">
  <h4>System Administrators</h4>
  Since the dawn of computing, sysadmins have had nightmares about letting
  developers loose on production systems. Cast is designed to let you worry
  about the systems while the developers worry about the code.

<div class="right_column">
  <h4>Developers</h4>
  Developers recognize the importance of good sysadmins. But while they're busy
  worrying about letting you on their systems your users are waiting for you to
  push that critical fix. Cast not only lets you push the fix without having to
  get on the system, Cast even makes it easy and safe.
