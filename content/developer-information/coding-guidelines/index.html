We know that different people like different styles, but we also know
that the consistency is very important and that is why we enforce
strict coding style. <br /><br />

Some of the rules are automatically enforced by jslint and other are manually
checked when doing code reviews. <br /><br />

Cast styling guide is largely based on the [Google JavaScript styling guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml),
but there are some additions, exceptions and differences which are documented bellow.

### Cast Styling Guide

* Always refer to the error variable which is passed to the callback as `err`
* Always refer to the callback function as `callback`
* Use dot notation (`person.height`) when accessing instances attributes, but use
dictionary notation (`config['port_number']`) when the object is used as a
hash-table / dictionary
* camelCase notation is used almost every where. Only exception to this rule are
constants, POST body values and the object key names in places where the object
is used as a hash-table / dictionary. In this places we use underscore-separated
notation. <br /><br />

**Example #1:**

{% syntax javascript %}
var body = querystring.stringify({
    bundle_name: bundleName,
    bundle_version: bundleVersion
});
...
request.end(body);
{% endsyntax %}

In this case, underscore-separated notation is used, because the values are sent
in the POST body.<br /><br />

**Example #2:**

{% syntax javascript %}
var COMMON_FIELDS = {
  'entry_file': {'type': 'string',
                 'required': true,
                 'description': 'Script or file which is run when starting the application'}
  }
}

var entry_file = COMMON_FIELDS['entry_file'];
{% endsyntax %}

In this case, underscore-separated notation is used because the object is used as
a dictionary.
