Cast is an open-source project released under the [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)
license so everyone is encouraged and welcome to contribute.<br /><br />

We accept many different kinds of contributions (code, tests, documentation,
ideas, ..)
which means that almost anyone is qualified to contribute.<br /><br />

If you need more information you are always welcome to join us on IRC or
start a new thread on our mailing list where we are happy to help you!

### Branching model

For the Cast main repository we follow the `git flow` branching model. You can find
a good, detailed description of this model in the post titled
["A successful Git branching model"](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

You are also advised to use [git-flow git extensions](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow)
which make following this branching model easier.

### Guidelines and rules for contributing

* If you are about to implement a new feature or a bigger change, start a
discussion on our [mailing list][3] first.

* Open a new issue on our [issue tracker][2] for every change.

* Create a new branch for every change, even if it is a one line bug fix (git
makes branching cheap and easy). Branch name should be in the following format:
`<ticket_id>_branch_name`.

* Every change must contain [tests](/developer-information/tests/). Test coverage of 90% and above is preferred.

* Stick to the [Coding Guidelines][1].

* Follow [git-flow branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

* After you are done with your change make sure that all the tests still pass.

* After you think your modifications are ready, open a pull request on Github so
others can review your code and provider further feedback.

### Vagrant Development Image

To make participation and development easier we have created a [Vagrant][] image
which contains everything required for you to start the Cast development.

For more information about getting and using the Vagrant image, please see
the [Vagrant image](/developer-information/vagrant/) page. The whole process of
setting up the image is very easy and straight-forward and it should not take more than 10 minutes.
