If you will be running the cast agent and client on different machines, or as
different users on the same machine, you will need to add the agent as a
'remote' from the client. Then, before the remote can be accessed you will need
to approve the certificate signing request submitted by the client when the
remote was added.

<h4 id="adding_remotes">Adding Remotes</h4>

**On the client:**

{% syntax bash %}
~ $ cast remotes add example https://apps.example.com
Your Email Address: russell@example.com
Name for this Client: russell-workstation
Certificate information
  Subject:
    CN: apps.example.com
  Issuer:
    CN: apps.example.com
  Valid to: Apr  5 23:42:42 2016 GMT
  Fingerprint: 09:09:A2:EB:4B:F0:FB:3F:2A:C0:9C:0A:B5:E6:C5:66:BE:8C:77:D5

Are you sure you want to accept this certificate (y/n) [n]? y
Remote added
{% endsyntax %}

This will prompt you for a hostname and email address. You can use anything you
like for these, but for the hostname you should choose something that uniquely
identifies the computer you are using as a client. It will also ask you to to
verify the agent's certificate before it sends any requests. You should compare
the fingerprint shown to the fingerprint that the agent displayed when it
started before accepting it.

<h4 id="signing_requests">Signing Requests</h4>

**On the server:**

{% syntax bash %}
# List pending requests - the one from your client should be the only one shown
~ $ cast ca list
Certificate Signing Requests (unsigned):

Hostname                                          Status
russell-workstation                               Awaiting Approval

# Sign your request
~ $ cast ca sign russell-workstation
CSR for 'russell-workstation': Approved
{% endsyntax %}

<h4 id="using_remotes">Using Remotes</h4>

The next time you connect to the agent, your signed certificate will be
automatically downloaded and used, without the need for further work on your
part. For any command that requires communication with an agent you may specify
the name of the remote to use with the `--remote <name>` option.
