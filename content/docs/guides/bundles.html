Cast bundles are simply a tarball of your application, but it is also necessary
to include a manifest file in order to tell the agent how to manage and run
your application. Other functionality can be accessed through hook scripts
which will be executed at various points during an application's life cycle.

<h4 id="cast_manifest">Cast Manifest Files</h4>

To initialize a manifest file use cast's [init command](/docs/client/init/),
specifying the entry file of your application as well as any other desired
attributes accessible via the init options. You will then be asked a series
of questions to generate a simple manifest file for your application.

Cast manifest files are documented in full in the [manifest file
reference](/docs/references/manifest-file/), but a high level overview of the
more notable attributes is provided here as an introduction.

##### Name

The `name` attribute is an arbitrary name given to your application. This is
used by the command line in naming bundle files (tarballs of your application),
but may be used more extensively in the future

##### Description

The `description` attribute is an arbitrary string describing your application.

##### Type

The `type` attribute describes the type of your application and is used by cast
to determine the best way to start your services. Currently cast supports
`shell` and `nodejs` types. Applications of the `shell` type have their entry
file (see below) executed with `/bin/sh` while those of the `nodejs` type have
their entry file executed by the same NodeJS executable that cast is using.

##### Entry File

The `entry_file` attribute contains the path (relative to the root of the
application) to the file that will be executed in accordance with the
application's `type`.

##### Template Files

The `template_files` attribute contains a list of relative paths to files that
should be processed by cast's [template system](/docs/references/templates/)
when an instance of the application is created. The most common use for this
is to generate configuration files based on the variables available to the
template system.

##### Data Files

The `data_files` attribute contains a list of relative paths to files that
should be treated as persistent data files and kept in place between upgrades.
This is done by creating symlinks at the specified paths into corresponding
locations in a persistent data directory. If the specified paths exist in the
application bundle they will be copied to the data location when an instance
of the application is first created. If the specified path does not exist, all
directories on the path will be created, but the file, if one is specified,
will not be created, the symlink will just be left dangling.

**Note:** Some applications (especially those which use `rename(2)` when saving
data files) will overwrite a symlink when they attempt to save to it, instead
of resolving the link and saving to its target. For this reason it is generally
recommended that a data *directory* be specified and that applications be
instructed to save to locations within that directory.

<h4 id="cast_hooks">Hooks</h4>

Hooks allow you to script actions that should occur at various points during
an application's lifecycle. For example in the [getting started](/start/)
tutorial we illustrate the use of hooks to compile an application when it is
being set up.

The [hooks reference](/docs/references/hooks/) describes available hooks in
detail.

<h4 id="cast_bundles">Creating and Uploading Bundles</h4>

Creating and uploading bundles is easy - just use the [bundles
create](/docs/client/bundles/create/) and [bundles
upload](/docs/client/bundles/upload/) commands. For example, to create and
upload a bundle for Redis we could do the following:

{% syntax bash %}
# Create a 'bundle' of the application - we have to tell it the version
~/redis $ cast bundles create v2.2.4-r0
Manifest validation succeeded, creating a bundle  |
Bundle created

# Upload the bundle
~/redis $ cast bundles upload
Uploading redis@v2.2.4-r0.tar.gz (2668438 bytes)
100% [=========================================================================]
Waiting for response...
Upload Successful
{% endsyntax %}

Note that the bundle is uploaded to the default remote (see the [remotes
guide](/docs/guides/remotes-management/#using_remotes) for details).
