<h3 id="script_install">Install latest stable version with the Cast installer</h3>

#### Installing runit

Cast only external dependency which is not included with the distribution
tarball and needs to be installed manually is [runit](http://smarden.org/runit/).

Bellow you can find installation instructions for most of the supported
operating system.

##### Ubuntu and Debian

If you are running Ubuntu or Debian you can simply install it using apt-get.

{% syntax bash %}
sudo apt-get install runit
{% endsyntax %}

##### Mac OS X

If you are using Mac OS X you can install it using ports

{% syntax bash %}
sudo port install runit
{% endsyntax %}

or homebrew.

{% syntax bash %}
sudo homebrew install runit
{% endsyntax %}

#### Installing Cast

After you have installed runit you need to obtain Cast distribution tarball.
You can find a link to the latest stable version on the [Downloads](/downloads/) 
page.

##### Download tarball, unpack it and move to the newly created directory

{% syntax bash %}
wget http://files.cast-project.org/cast-<version>.tar.gz
tar -xzvf cast-<version>.tar.gz
cd cast-<version>
{% endsyntax %}

##### Install Cast and NodeJS using the installer

{% syntax bash %}
scons install
{% endsyntax %}

By default Cast and all the dependencies get installed into the `/opt/cast/`
directory.

If you want to change this path you can use the `--prefix=PATH` option.

By default the installer will also compile and install the bundled version of
NodeJS into the Cast prefix (`/opt/cast/`).

If you already have a supported version of NodeJS installed on your system, you
can use the `--use-system-node` option which means that the installer won't compile
and install bundled version of NodeJS, but it will use a version which is already
present on the system.

<h3 id="source_install">Install development version from source</h3>

To install Cast from source you will first need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
and [runit](http://smarden.org/runit/). Exactly how you install these is up to
you, but the following procedures should work on recent versions of Ubuntu.

##### Installing Node.js

We recommend building Node.js from source to make sure you have a
recent version.

{% syntax bash %}
~ $ git clone git://github.com/joyent/node.git
~ $ cd node
~/node $ ./configure
~/node $ make && sudo make install
{% endsyntax %}

##### Installing Runit

Runit hasn't changed  much recently, so installing it with your package manager
should be fine.

{% syntax bash %}
~ $ sudo apt-get install runit
{% endsyntax %}

##### Installing Cast

Finally you need Cast itself. Clone it to wherever you want to install it.

{% syntax bash %}
~ $ git clone git://github.com/cloudkick/cast.git
{% endsyntax %}

Then add cast's `bin` directory to your `PATH`.
