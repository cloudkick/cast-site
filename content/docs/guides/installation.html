<h3 id="installing_runit">Installing runit</h3>

[runit](http://smarden.org/runit/) is a service manager which is used to
manage and supervise Cast services.

Bellow you can find installation instructions for most of the supported
platforms.

##### Ubuntu and Debian

If you are running Ubuntu or Debian you can simply install it using apt-get.

{% syntax bash %}
~ $ sudo apt-get install runit
{% endsyntax %}

##### Mac OS X

If you are using Mac OS X you can install it using ports

{% syntax bash %}
sudo port install runit
{% endsyntax %}

or homebrew.

{% syntax bash %}
~ $ sudo homebrew install runit
{% endsyntax %}

<h3 id="installing_scons">Installing Scons</h3>

[Scons](http://www.scons.org/) is a build tool which is used to install Cast.

Scons is also used by Node.js and V8 which means that if you have installed
Node.js from source it should already be present on your system and you can
skip this step.

If that is not the case, installation instructions for most of the supported
operating systems can be found bellow.

##### Ubuntu and Debian

If you are running Ubuntu or Debian you can simply install it using apt-get.

{% syntax bash %}
~ $ sudo apt-get install scons
{% endsyntax %}

##### Mac OS X

If you are using Mac OS X you can install it using ports

{% syntax bash %}
~ $ sudo port install scons
{% endsyntax %}

or homebrew.

{% syntax bash %}
~ $ sudo homebrew install scons
{% endsyntax %}

<h3 id="script_install">Install latest stable version with the Cast installer</h3>

#### Installing Cast

After you have installed all the dependencies you need to obtain Cast distribution
tarball.
You can find a link to the latest stable version on the [Downloads](/downloads/)
page.

##### Download tarball, unpack it and move to the newly created directory

{% syntax bash %}
~ $ wget http://files.cast-project.org/cast-<version>.tar.gz
~ $ wget http://files.cast-project.org/cast-<version>.tar.gz.md5sum
~ $ tar -xzvf cast-<version>.tar.gz
~ $ cd cast-<version>
{% endsyntax %}

##### Verify the downloaded file MD5 sum

{% syntax bash %}
~ $ md5sum -c cast-<version>.tar.gz.md5sum
{% endsyntax %}

If the downloaded file MD5 sum matches the on specified in the .md5sum file, you
should see a similar message:

{% syntax bash %}
cast-<version>.tar.gz: OK
{% endsyntax %}

##### Install Cast and Node.js using the installer

{% syntax bash %}
~ $ scons install
{% endsyntax %}

By default Cast and all the dependencies get installed into the `/opt/cast/`
directory.

If you want to change this path you can use the `CASTPREFIX` variable.

For example, if you want to install Cast into `/opt/apps` directory, you would run
the following command:

{% syntax bash %}
~ $ scons install CASTPREFIX=/opt/apps
{% endsyntax %}

By default the installer will also compile and install the bundled version of
Node.js into the Cast prefix (`/opt/cast/`).

If you already have a supported version of Node.js installed on your system, you
can use the `--use-system-node` option which means that the installer won't compile
and install bundled version of Node.js, but it will use a version which is already
present on the system.

<h3 id="source_install">Install development version from source</h3>

To install Cast from source you will first need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
and [runit](http://smarden.org/runit/). Exactly how you install these is up to
you, but the following procedures should work on recent versions of Ubuntu.

##### Installing Node.js

We recommend building Node.js from source to make sure you have a
recent version.

{% syntax bash %}
~ $ git clone git://github.com/joyent/node.git
~ $ cd node
~/node $ ./configure
~/node $ make && sudo make install
{% endsyntax %}

##### Installing Runit

Runit hasn't changed  much recently, so installing it with your package manager
should be fine.

{% syntax bash %}
~ $ sudo apt-get install runit
{% endsyntax %}

##### Installing Cast

Finally you need Cast itself. Clone it to wherever you want to install it.

{% syntax bash %}
~ $ git clone git://github.com/cloudkick/cast.git
~ $ git checkout develop
{% endsyntax %}

Then add cast's `bin` directory to your `PATH`.
