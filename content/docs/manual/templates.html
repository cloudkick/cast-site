Templates are special files which have access to the different context variables and
are rendered when the instance is created and upgraded.

Templates also allow user to define extra variables which can be then accessed
in all the template files.

This for example allow you to define some application specific settings which
can than be accessed in all the templates.

### Context variables

In each template you have access to the following objects:

* facts - different facts about the server on which the agent is running:
    * `arch` - server architecture
    * `gnutar` - path to the GNU tar compatible binary (tar / gtar / gnutar)
    * `hostname` - server hostname
    * `kernel` - kernel version (available on Linux, FreeBSD and OS X)
    * `node_binary` - path to the node binary which is running the agent
    * `node_version` - version of the node which is running the agent
    * `runsvdir_running` - true if runit is currently monitoring the Cast
    services enabled path, false otherwise
    * `username` - username of the user running the agent

* user_defined - variables defined by the user in the manifest file
(`template_variables` attribute)

* instance - different information about the current instance:
    * `name` - instance name
    * `path` - path to the instance directory

### Template tags

Syntax used in the templates is inspired by the Django templates which means that
most of the tags have the same name and behave the same as the equivalent Django
template tags.

## accessing a variable value

{% syntax javascript \%}
{% endsyntax %}

#### for loop

{% syntax javascript %}
{% endsyntax %}

### if

{% syntax javascript %}
{% endsyntax %}
