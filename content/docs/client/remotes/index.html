The 'cast remotes' command allows you to manage your local 'remotes' files.
Cast uses 'remotes' in much the way that git does - the main difference is that
cast allows you to specify remotes for each project as well as a set of global
remotes. This allows you to, for example, have a unique 'dev' remote for each
of your projects.
