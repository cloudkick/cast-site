Hooks are scripts written in arbitrary programming languages which are executed
by the Cast agent at different stages.

The scripts must be executable and get passed in different arguments depending
on the state and the context in which the hook has been executed.

Hook is considered to complete successfully if it exists with a zero exit code,
exiting with any other non-zero exit code signals a failure.

Hook is also considered to fail (time out) if it does not complete in some
pre-defined time period (this period depends on the hook type).

### Available Hooks

Here is a list and a description of the currently available hooks.

#### Instance hooks

Instance hooks are tied to an instance and must be located in the
`.cast_project/` directory in your application root. 

##### post_prepare

This hook is executed after the instance has been prepared. Instance is
considered to be prepared after the instance directory has been created, all the
application files have been hard-linked into place and the templates have been
rendered, but before the actual service has been created.

**Hook location**: `.cast-project/post-prepare`  
**Timeout**: 50 seconds  
**Arguments (1)**:

* `version` - bundle version which has been prepared

#### pre_version_activate

This hook is executed before the instance version has been activated.

**Hook location**: `.cast-project/pre_version_activate`  
**Timeout**: 50 seconds  
**Arguments (2)**:

* `version` - version which is about to be activated
* `version_path` - path to the about to be activated version bundle directory

#### post_version_activate

This hook is executed after the instance version has been activated.

**Hook location**: `.cast-project/post_version_activate`  
**Timeout**: 50 seconds  
**Arguments (2)**:

* `version` - version which has been activated
* `version_path` - path to the bundle directory of the version which has been
activated
