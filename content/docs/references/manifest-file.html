Cast manifest file is a JSON file which contains different information,
requirements and facts about your application.

The manifest file must be named `cast.json` and located in the root of
your application directory.

1. [Manifest File Attributes](#manifest_file_attributes)
2. [Manifest Example](#manifest_example)

<h3 id="manifest_file_attributes">Manifest File Attributes</h3>

Here is a list and a description of all the attributes which can be defined
in the `cast.json` file.

* `name` (required) - the name of your application

* `description` (required) - a short description of your application

* `type` (required) - type of your application. Currently supported types are:
    * `nodejs` - Node.js application which will be run by the same node executable
  which runs the agent.
    * `shell` - A shell script which will be executed by the service manager. This
  type can represent practically any application or service. Only requirement is
  that the `entry_file` is executable. The `entry_file` can for example be
  a simple shell script which starts your database server (Redis, MongoDB,
  Cassandra, ...).

* `entry_file` (required) - a file which is run when starting your application. For Node.js
applications this is usually `server.js`. If not provided it defaults to
`server.json` for Node.js applications and `shell.sh` for shell applications.

* `template_files` - a list of the templates will which will be rendered when
creating or upgrading an instance.

Each template file has access to the following context objects:

* `facts` - different facts about the server on which the agent is running
(architecture, hostname, node version, etc.)

* `instance` - different information about the current instance (name, version,
etc.)

* `user_defined` - context variables defined by the user. For more information,
please see `template_variables` attribute.

* `template_variables` - An object which contains extra context variables
which will be available in the templates.

* `data_files` - A list of relative paths to the data files.

Data files are files which are modified or created during the application
run-time (database files, files uploaded by the users, etc.). Those files are
special because they are preserved between instance upgrades.

Note: Each path must be relative to the application root and must not contain
a leading slash. If a data file is a directory it must contain trailing slash -
this is required because it is not necessary that the data file already exist
when the application is started so we can't the automatically detect the data
file type.

Fields described bellow are here for the future reference and are simply ignored
in the current version.

* `health_checks` - a list of health checks which are applied to your
application. Health checks monitor your application or service for defects or
abnormal behavior and trigger different scripts if your application becomes
unreachable or some other user-defined threshold has been been reached.

<h3 id="manifest_example">Manifest Example</h3>

Here is an example manifest file which utilizes all the fields described above.

{% syntax javascript %}
{
  "name": "Sample Node.js application",
  "description": "A sample Node.js application controlled by Cast",
  "type": "nodejs",
  "data_files": [ "data/visitor_log.dat" ],
  "template_files": [ "server.js" ],
  "template_variables": { "welcome_msg": "Hello Cast!",
                          "server_port": 8000,
                          "data_file": "data/visitor_log.dat"}
}
{% endsyntax %}

In this example we have a single data file which is used to store an IP address
and a date of all the users which have visited our application.

A sample application which goes with the manifest field above can be found on
github: [https://github.com/cloudkick/cast-sample-node-app/](https://github.com/cloudkick/cast-sample-node-app/).
