Data files represent different files and directories which are created and / or
modified during the application run-time.

Data files are special because they are stored in a common directory and preserved
between the instance upgrades.

Some things which can be classified and represented as data files are:

* content uploaded by the users (images, files, etc.),
* different log files created by the application,
* database files,
* etc.

### Using and specifying data files

Lets imagine we have an application which allows user to upload images and
stores some application specific log files in a separate directory.

Images are stored in a directory `user_images/` and log files are stored in a
directory `logs/`.

For these two directories to be preserved during the instance upgrades, the
`data_files` attribute in the manifest file should look like this:

{% syntax javascript %}
"data_files": [ "user_images/", "logs/" ]
{% endsyntax %}

*Note: All the paths in the `data_files` array should be relative to the
application root and should contain a trailing slash if a specified path is a
directory.*

When first creating an instance the agent will create a special directory for
storing the data files which is shared across all the instance versions and also
appropriate symbolic links to the currently active application version directory.

If the any of the directory or file specified in the `data_files` array already 
exists in the bundle it will be copied (with all the content) to the shared data 
directory before creating all the appropriate symbolic links.

So in this case when your application will save a file to the
`<application_root>/user_images/` directory this file will actually be saved to
`<cast_root>/application/<application_name>/data/user_images/`.

Keep in mind that the `user_images` directory in the application root is a
symbolic link which means that you should never overwrite it, otherwise you will
break the data file functionality.
