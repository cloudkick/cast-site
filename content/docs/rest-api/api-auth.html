## Cast API Authentication

Cast employs two separate authentication methods: X.509 certificate based
authentication and shared secret based authentication.

### Certificate-based Authentication

By default SSL is enabled on the cast agent, and it is configured to verify
client certificates.

To disable client certificate verification, either set `ssl_enabled: false`
(this will disable SSL entirely) or set `verify_client_cert: false` in
`config.json` on the Cast Agent.

To make authenticated requests to the agent you must use a certificate signed
by the CA key corresponding to `ca.crt` on the agent.

#### Retrieving Certificates

While you are free to manage your own certificate infrastructure, the Cast
Agent also provides a built in certificate authority.

To retrieve a signed certificate from a Cast Agent you can just use the Cast
Client to [add and approve a remote](/docs/guides/remotes-management/), then
copy the certificate from `~/.cast/certs/<remote-name>.crt` and key from
`~/.cast/cast.key`.

If you want to write your own client for the Cast certificate authority,
check out the [certificate authority API documentation](/docs/rest-api/ca/).

### Shared Key Authentication

Cast's implementation of shared key authentication works creating a sha256
HMAC using the `secret` config option as a key, then hashing:

1. The HTTP method (ie, 'GET', 'PUT', etc)
2. The request path
3. A random string, set as the 'x-cast-nonce' header

Then setting the 'x-cast-signature' header to the base64 value of the hash.

In Node.js you could implement a client as follows:

{% syntax javascript %}
var http = require('http');
var crypto = require('crypto');

var SECRET = 'password';
var METHOD = 'GET';
var PATH = '/1.0/facts/';
var NONCE = 'some_random_string';

var hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', SECRET);

hmac.update(METHOD);
hmac.update(PATH);
hmac.update(NONCE);

var opts = {
  host: 'localhost',
  port: '49443',
  method: METHOD,
  path: PATH,
  headers: {
    'x-cast-nonce': NONCE,
    'x-cast-signature': hmac.digest('base64')
  }
};

http.request(opts, function(res) {
  var body = '';

  res.setEncoding('utf8');
  res.on('data', function(chunk) {
    body += chunk;
  });

  res.on('end', function() {
    console.log(body);
  });
}).end();
